Create a variable called age and set it to 15
Create a variable called voting_age and set it to 18
Create a variable called retirement_age and set it to 65

# Age-based conditions
If age is less than voting_age:
    Print "You are too young to vote"
    Create a variable called years_until_voting and set it to 0
    Add voting_age and -1 and store the result in modified_voting_age
    Add modified_voting_age and -1 and store the result in neg_age
    Add voting_age and -1 and store the result in difference
    Print difference
    
If age is greater than voting_age and age is less than retirement_age:

    Set result to "A"
Else if score is greater than 80:
    Set result to "B"
Else if score is greater than 70:
