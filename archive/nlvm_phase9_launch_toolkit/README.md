# NLVM – The Human Language Virtual Machine

**NLVM** is the world's first virtual machine that executes plain English as code.

## 🔥 Why It Matters
- Write and run programs using human language — no syntax
- Create variables, loops, lists, APIs, file operations – all in English
- Works for kids, students, and professionals alike
- It’s not code generation. It’s a new language paradigm.

## 🧠 Example
```
Create a variable called x and set it to 5
Add x and 10 and store the result in sum
Print sum
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Compile
python nl_compiler.py

# Run in NLVM
python nlvm.py
```

## ✨ Core Components
- `nl_compiler.py`: Converts English to NLVM bytecode (.nlc)
- `nlvm.py`: Executes NLVM bytecode
- `program.nl`: Human-readable English code
- `program.nlc`: Compiled NLVM bytecode

## 🌟 The Future of Code Is Human
NLVM is not just a tool – it's the start of a new language for humanity.
