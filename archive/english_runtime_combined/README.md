# English Runtime - Combined Edition

This is the combined edition of the English Runtime programming language, merging the advanced features of Phase 5 with the improved multi-interface architecture of Phase 6.

## Overview

English Runtime allows programming in plain English rather than traditional programming syntax. This implementation combines:

- Advanced language features from Phase 5 (functions, conditionals, loops)
- Multiple interface options from Phase 6 (CLI and Web)

## Features

* Variables and data types (numbers, strings, booleans)
* Lists and dictionaries
* Functions with parameters and return values
* Conditional statements (if/else)
* Loops (while and for-each)
* CLI interface for direct interaction
* Web interface for browser-based programming

## Usage

### CLI Interface

Run the command-line interface:

```
python cli_app.py
```

### Web Interface

Run the web interface:

```
cd web
python web_app.py
```

Then open a browser to http://localhost:5000

## Example Programs

### Simple Variable Operations

```
Create a variable called counter and set it to 10
Add counter and 5 and store the result in sum
Print sum
```

### Function Definition and Calling

```
Define a function called multiply with inputs a and b:
    Add a and b and store the result in total
    Return total
Call multiply with values 5 and 6 and store result in product
Print product
```

### List Operations

```
Create a list called numbers with values 5, 10, 15
Get the length of list numbers and store it in count
Print count
```

### Conditionals

```
Create a variable called age and set it to 20
If age is greater than 18:
    Print age
```
