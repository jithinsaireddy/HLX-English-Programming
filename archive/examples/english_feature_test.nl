# English Programming - Comprehensive Feature Test

# Basic variable operations
create a variable called counter and set it to 1
create a variable called total and set it to 0

# While loop demonstration
print "Testing while loop:"
while counter is less than 6:
    print counter
    add counter to total and store the result in total
    add 1 to counter and store the result in counter

print "Sum of numbers from 1 to 5:"
print total

# For-each loop with a list
print "Testing for-each loop:"
create a variable called fruits and set it to ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for each fruit in fruits:
    print fruit

# Conditional logic with else-if
print "Testing if-else-if:"
create a variable called score and set it to 85

if score is greater than 90:
    print "Grade: A"
else if score is greater than 80:
    print "Grade: B"
else if score is greater than 70:
    print "Grade: C"
else:
    print "Grade: D"

# Function definition and calling
define a function called multiply with inputs x and y:
    multiply x by y and store the result in product
    return product

call multiply with values 5 and 6 and store result in multiplication_result
print "5 Ã— 6 ="
print multiplication_result

# Dictionary operations
create a variable called person and set it to {"name": "John", "age": 30}
print "Person name:"
print person["name"]

# String operations
create a variable called greeting and set it to "Hello, "
create a variable called name and set it to "World"
concatenate greeting and name and store it in message
print message
