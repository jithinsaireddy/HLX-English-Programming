 # NOTE: This app uses the Docker platform, not the Python platform.
 # The following Python container option caused EB validation error:
 #   Unknown or duplicate parameter: WSGIPath
 # Keep this file commented out while on Docker. Our Dockerfile starts
 # Gunicorn with wsgi:application and does not need WSGIPath.
 #
 # If you ever switch back to the Python platform, restore the block below:
 # option_settings:
 #   aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
 #     WSGIPath: wsgi.py
